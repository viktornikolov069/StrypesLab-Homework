Stages of Compilation

main.c ---> Preprocessor -> (main.i) ---> Compile -> (main.s) ---> Assembly -> (main.o) ---> Linker 

"Static Libs" ---> Linker -> a.out ---> Loader

"Dynamic Libs" ---> Loader ---> Process

========================================================

Explanation

0. The Loader isn't part of the compilation process but I have included for better clarity.

1. The "main.c" file goes through the Preprocessor. The Preprocessor handles preprocessor directives,
   includes the content of header files into source files, expands macros etc. 

2. The code is compiled or translated to intermediate assembly code specific to the target platform.

3. The assembler converts the assembly code in to an object file which contains machine readable code.

4. The Linker links source and object files together.

5. The Loader includes dynamic libraries and moves our program from HDD to RAM starting a process.

========================================================

Difference between static and dynamic Libs

1. Static libs are copied or linked in each program at compile time. 
2. Shared libs can be shared between multiple processes at runtime.
